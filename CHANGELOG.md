- Added a guided distributor mode which allows defining a specific distribution of data
  on a per directory or file basis ([!39](https://storage.bsc.es/gitlab/hpc/gekkofs/-/merge_requests/39)).
- For developers:
  - A convenience library has been added for unit testing
    ([!94](https://storage.bsc.es/gitlab/hpc/gekkofs/-/merge_requests/94)).

  the number of required RPCs per operation ([!60](https://storage.bsc.es/gitlab/hpc/gekkofs/-/merge_requests/60)).
- Syscall_intercept now supports glibc version 2.3 or newer
  ([!72](https://storage.bsc.es/gitlab/hpc/gekkofs/-/merge_requests/72)).

  fixed ([!79](https://storage.bsc.es/gitlab/hpc/gekkofs/-/merge_requests/79)).
- The daemon can now be restarted without losing its
  namespace ([!85](https://storage.bsc.es/gitlab/hpc/gekkofs/-/merge_requests/85)).

  ([!116](https://storage.bsc.es/gitlab/hpc/gekkofs/-/merge_requests/116)).
- Fixed an issue where `LOG_OUTPUT_TRUNC` did not work as
  expected ([!118](https://storage.bsc.es/gitlab/hpc/gekkofs/-/merge_requests/118)).

## [0.8.0] - 2020-09-15

### New

- Both client library and daemon have been extended to support the ofi+verbs
  protocol.
- A new Python testing harness has been implemented to support integration
  tests. The end goal is to increase the robustness of the code in the mid- to
  long-term.
- The RPC protocol and the usage of shared memory for intra-node communication
  no longer need to be activated on compile time. New arguments
  `-P|--rpc-protocol` and `--auto-sm` have been added to the daemon to this
  effect. This configuration options are propagated to clients when they
  initialize and contact daemons.
- Native support for the Omni-Path network protocol by choosing the `ofi+psm2`
  RPC protocol. Note that this requires `libfabric`'s version to be greater
  than `1.8` as well as `psm2` to be installed in the system. Clients must set
  `FI_PSM2_DISCONNECT=1` to be able to reconnect once the client is shut down
  once.
  *Known limitations:* Client reconnect doesn't always work. Apparently, if
  clients reconnect too fast the servers won't accept the connections. Also,
  currently more than 16 clients per node are not supported.
- A new execution mode called `GekkoFWD` that allows GekkoFS to run as
  a user-level I/O forwarding infrastructure for applications. In this mode,
  I/O operations from an application are intercepted and forwarded to a single
  GekkoFS daemon that is chosen according to a pre-defined distribution. In the
  daemons, the requests are scheduled using the AGIOS scheduling library before
  they are dispatched to the shared backend parallel file system.
- The `fsync()` system call is now fully supported.

### Improved

- Argobots tasks in the daemon are now wrapped in a dedicated class,
  effectively removing the dependency. This lays ground work for future
  non-Argobots I/O implementations.
- The `readdir()` implementation has been refactored and improved.
- Improvements on how to the installation scripts manage dependencies.

### Fixed

- The server sometimes crashed due to uncaught system errors in the storage
  backend. This has now been fixed.
- Fixed a bug that broke `ls` on some architectures.
- Fixed a bug that leaked internal errors from the interception library to
  client applications via `errno` propagation.

## [0.7.0] - 2020-02-05

### Added

- Added support for `eventfd()`and `eventfd2()` system calls.

### Changed

- Replaced Margo with Mercury in the client library in order to increase
  application compatibility: the Argobots ULTs used by Margo to send and
  process RPCs clashed at times with applications using pthreads.
- Renamed environment variables to better distinguish which variables affect
  the client library (`LIBGKFS_*`) and which affect the daemon
  (`GKFS_DAEMON_*`).
- Replaced spdlog in the client with a bespoke logging infrastructure:
  spdlog's internal threads and exception management often had issues with the
  system call interception infrastructure. The current logging infrastructure
  is designed around the syscall interception mechanism, and is therefore more
  stable.
- Due to the new logging infrastructure, there have been significant changes
  to the environment variables controlling logging output. The desired log
  module is now set with `LIBGKFS_LOG`, while the desired output channel is
  controlled with `LIBGKFS_LOG_OUTPUT`. Additional options such as
  `LIBGKFS_LOG_OUTPUT_TRUNC`, `LOG_SYSCALL_FILTER` and `LOG_DEBUG_VERBOSITY`
  can be used to further control messages. Run the client with
  `LIBGKFS_LOG=help` for more details.
- Improved dependency management in CMake.

### Fixed

- Relocate internal file descriptors to a private range to avoid interfering
  with client application file descriptors.
- Handle internal file descriptors created by `fcntl()`.
- Handle internal file descriptors passed to processes using `CMSG_DATA` in
  `recvmsg()`.

## [0.6.2] - 2019-10-07

### Added

- Paths inside kernel pseudo filesystems (`/sys`, `/proc`) are forwarded directly to the kernel and internal path
  resolution will be skipped. Be aware that also paths like  `/sys/../tmp/gkfs_mountpoint/asd` will be forwarded to the
  kernel
- Added new Cmake flag `CREATE_CHECK_PARENTS` to controls if the existance of the parent node needs to be checked during
  the creation of a child node.

### Changed

- Daemon logs for RPC handlers have been polished
- Updated Margo, Mercury and Libfabric dependencies

### Fixed

- mk_node RPC wasn't propagating errors correctly from daemons
- README has been improoved and got some minor fixes
- fix wrong path in log call for mk_symlink function

## [0.6.1] - 2019-09-17

### Added

- Added new Cmake flag `LOG_SYSCALLS` to enable/disable syscall logging.
- Intercept the 64 bit version of `getdents`.
- Added debian-based docker image.

### Changed

- Disable syscalls logging by default
- Update Mercury, RocksDB and Libfabric dependencies

### Fixed

- Fix read at the end of file.
- Don't create log file when using `--version`/`--help` cli flags.
- On some systems LD_PRELOAD used on /bin/bash binary was not working.
- Missing definition of `loff_t` on new version of GCC.

## [0.6.0] - 2019-07-26

### Added

- Add compile time option to disable shared memory communication `-DUSE_SHM:BOOL=OFF`

### Changed

- Deamons does not store anymore information about the others deamons.
- Improoved error handling on deamon initialization
- Decreased RPC timeout 3min -> 3sec
- Update 3rd party dependencies

### Removed

- PID file is not used anymore, we use only the new `hosts file` for out of bound communication
- Dropped CCI plugin support
- Dropped hostname-suffix cli option
- Dropped port cli option (use `--listen` instead)
- It is not needed anymore to pass hosts information to deamons, thus the `--hosts` cli have been removed

### Fixed

- Errors on get_dirents RPC are now reported back to clients
- Write errors happenig on deamons are now reported back to clients
- number overflow on lseek didn't allow to use seek on huge files

## [0.5.0] - 2019-04-29

### Changed

- Intercept I/O syscalls instead of GlibC function
  using [syscall intercept library](https://github.com/pmem/syscall_intercept)

## [0.4.0] - 2019-04-18

First GekkoFS public release

This version provides a client library that uses GLibC I/O function interception.

## [0.3.1] - 2018-03-04

### Changed

- Read-write process improved. @Marc vef
- Improved Filemap. @Marc Vef
